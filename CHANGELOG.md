<!-- next-header -->
## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate
### Changed
- Update `embedded-hal-bus` dependency to 0.3.0

- If feature `async` is enabled, the `embedded_hal_async::i2c::I2c`  is used instead of `embedded_hal::i2c::I2c`  so the I2C can be shared
- Update dependencies for  `embassy-executor` to 0.7.0

- Switch `embassy-time` from git to crates.io
- Update dependencies for `tinybmp` to 0.5.0
- Update root-toolchain  to  1.84  for  github workflow in ci.yml

## [0.9.0] - 2024-08-30

- Updated dependencies for `embedded-hal` 1.0.0.
- Switch examples to embassy STM32 PAC which implements `embedded-hal` 1.0.0 traits.
- Add an asynchronous interface, enabled via the `async` feature.
- **(breaking)** Increased MSRV to 1.75.0

### Added

- [#203](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/203) Added `Ssd1306::release(self)` to release the contained i2c interface.

### Changed

- [#212](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/ssd1306/pull/212) Switch
  from circleci to github actions. Adjust urls now repository is hosted on
  rust-embedded-community. Update code and config for modern rust and tools

## [0.8.4] - 2023-10-27

### Fixed

- [#201](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/201) Fixed `BufferedGraphicsMode::clear(On)` such that it fills all pixels with `On`, not only some.

## [0.8.3] - 2023-10-09

### Changed

- [#195](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/195) Changed `BasicMode::clear` to clear in
  small batches instead of one big write. This drops RAM requirement by ~900b and fixes issues on
  MCUs with less than 1Kb of RAM.
- [#195](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/195) Changed `TerminalMode` to use lookup by
  ASCII code instead of per-character match when searching for glyph. This may save up to 3.5Kb of
  compiled code on AVR MCUs.

## [0.8.2] - 2023-09-29

### Fixed

- [#197](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/197) Fixed terminal mode panic and wrapping
  behaviour for rotated displays.

  screen pixels

  0.4
- **(breaking)** [#185](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/185) The inherent
  `BufferedGraphicsMode::clear` has been renamed to `clear_buffer`.
- [#185](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/185) Some methods no longer require
  `DI: WriteOnlyDataCommand`.

## [0.7.1] - 2022-08-15

### Added

- [#161](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/161) Added a `set_mirror` method to enable or
  disable display mirroring.

### Changed

- **(breaking)** [#156](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/156) Migrate from
  `embedded-graphics` to `embedded-graphics-core`.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150)
  `BufferedGraphicsMode::set_pixel` now accepts a `bool` instead of a `u8` for the pixel color
  value.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150) `display_on` is now called
  `set_display_on`.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150) `TerminalMode::get_position`
  is now called `position` to conform with Rust API guidelines.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150) Refactor the crate API to be
  more versatile and to make code clearer to understand.

  A graphics mode initialisation now looks like this:

  ```rust
  use ssd1306::{prelude::*, I2CDisplayInterface, Ssd1306};

  let interface = I2CDisplayInterface::new(i2c);

  let mut display = Ssd1306::new(interface, DisplaySize128x64, DisplayRotation::Rotate0)
      .into_buffered_graphics_mode();

  display.init().unwrap();
  ```

### Changed

- [#137](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/137) Replaced `TerminalMode` font with a new,

  display size.

- **(breaking)** [#112](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/112) Upgrade to embedded-graphics
  0.6.0
- [#107](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/107) Migrate from Travis to CircleCI
- [#105](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/105) Reduce flash usage by around 400 bytes by
  replacing some internal `unwrap()`s with `as` coercions.
- [#106](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/106) Optimise internals by using iterators to

### Added

- [#101](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/101) Add support for modules with a 72x40px
  display size. These are often advertised as 70x40px displays which are likely the same hardware.
  An example is also added - `graphics_i2c_72x40`.

### Fixed

- Fix docs.rs build by targeting `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

### Changed

- **(breaking)** Upgrade embedded-graphics from `0.6.0-alpha.2` to version `0.6.0-alpha.3`
- [#106](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/106) Switch out some `for` loops for iterators
  internally to speed up data transfers and reduce code size in `--release` mode.

## [0.3.0-alpha.3] - 2020-02-03

### Changed

- [#97](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/97) Use the new `Triangle` primitive from
  Embedded Graphics 0.6.0-alpha.2 in the three SSD1306 `graphics*.rs` examples
- [#103](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/103) Pin embedded-graphics version to
  0.6.0-alpha.2

## [0.3.0-alpha.2]

### Fixed

- [#80](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/80) `TerminalMode` now has a cursor. Newlines
  (`\n`) and carriage returns (`\r`) are now supported.

### Changed

- [#94](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/94) Programs that only change some parts of the
  display should now run much faster. The driver keeps track of changed pixels and only sends a
  bounding box of updated pixels instead of updating the entire display every time.

## [0.3.0-alpha.1]

### Changed

- **(breaking)** Upgraded to Embedded Graphics 0.6.0-alpha.2

## 0.2.6

### Added

- Added a changelog!
- Display power control (#86) - call `.display_on(true)` or `.display_on(false)` to turn on or off
  the display respectively.

### Fixed

- Doc examples are now tested in CI (#89)

### Changed

- Builder docs clarify the order of method calls (#89)
